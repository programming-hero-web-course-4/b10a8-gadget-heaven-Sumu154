## React Fundamentals Used
This project demonstrates the use of the following React concepts:

1. **Components**: Functional components are used to build reusable UI elements such as `Categories`, `Products`, and `NavBar`.
2. **Props**: Passing data between parent and child components for dynamic rendering.
3. **State Management**: `useState` is used to manage local states like selected categories and other UI states.
4. **Routing**: `react-router-dom` is used for navigation and nested layouts.
5. **Effects**: `useEffect` is used for fetching data dynamically and updating UI accordingly.



## Data Handling and Management
- **Context API**: The project uses `React Context API` to manage shared data like cart items, wishlist, total cost, and comments across components.
